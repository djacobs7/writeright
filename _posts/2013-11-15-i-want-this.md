I want this and you won't let me have it


My goal is to write a television show, novel or short story or short film.

To do this, I need to be able to craft scenes which are interesting and compelling.  And I need a process I can rely on for doing this again and again.

Most good scenes have characters pursuing an object in the face of some sort of obstacle.  Go ahead and watch some television or read a book and see if you can identify this pattern.  Even on Seinfeld, where 'nothing' is happening, the characters are pursuing some sort of goal, its hard for them to get it, and unintended things occur.  Thats why we like the show. ( If you don't enjoy Seinfeld, just stop reading here.  You are a lost cause. )
 
Last week, we worked on having a character following an objective.    This week, we will focus on the obstacle that prevents the character from achieving their goal.  

Some other people who write about writing call this a 'conflict'. Better to call it 'obstacle' because it matches 'objective' and we can keep an 'ob' theme.  

Obstacle is what is preventing a character from getting what he or she wants.  ( Thats a quote from Stuart Spencer )


Here is the exercise:
Write a scene with two characters. Alice wants something from Bob, and Bob wants something from Alice.  
You have to use the sentence "I want this and you won't let me have it" at least one time.

Here is how you might approach this:

You might first identify a need for Alice, the thing she will pursue in the scene.  Make sure her need is something Bob and only Bob can provide.  Bob is the obstacle, Bob will not let Alice get what she wants.

For example:

- Alice wants to kiss Bob.  Bob does not want to be kissed.
- Alice wants to kill Bob.  Bob does not want to be killed.
- Alice wants Bob to give her a piggyback ride.  Bob does not want to do this.

But thats not all.  Bob has some objective also in this scene.  Bob wants something from Alice.  
Alice is Bob's obstacle, Alice will not give Bob what he wants.

Bob wants Alice's book.  Alice does not want to give it up.
Bob wants Alice's glass of water.  Alice does not want to give it up ( it is the last glass of water )

Now, combine these two things, and write a scene!

For example:
Alice wants to kiss Bob.  Bob does not want to be kissed.  Bob wants Alice's glass of water.  Alice does not want to give it up because it is the last glass of water.

Keep in mind that at its core, this is an exercise about characters pursuing an objective faced with an obstacle.

* Alice's objective does not change during the scene   (unless it is right at the very end)
* Bob's objective does not change during the scene  (unless it is right at the very end)
* Don't worry about what happens when the characters get what they want.  That will be the focus of next time.
* try to make the characters emotionally invested in what is going on 
* stay honest to your characters
* If you don't know what should happen next:
   * raise the stakes
   * let the character try a new tact once they find their current one is not working 
* It is harder to write with two characters then with one
   * you might consider having a main character who is the important one
   * this will probably involve some dialog
* It can be challenging to show two characters pursuing objectives that can be at odds with each other at the same time
   *  Think about this sentence: "Bob blindly reached his hands towards Alices water while pointing his mouth up towards the air in order to avoid Alice's approaching puckered lips."  
    Both characters are pursuing their goal in a single beat.  That's nice when that happens, but, its also hard to construct moments like that.  
    To avoid that problem, it might help to think of this as two separate scenes happening in the same time in place.  In each scene, each character has an objective and an obstacle.  In a single 'beat'  one character is pursuing the objective, and the other is the obstacle.  On the next beat, the characters would switch roles.  


I suggest going through the work of writing several sentences like the ones below, to get a basic feeling of whats going on.  Feel free to swap Alice and Bob's names with the names of whoever you like.  Here are some samples:

- Alice wants to kiss Bob.  Bob does not want to be kissed.  Bob wants Alice return her cups when she is done using them.  Alice does not want to do that.
- Alice wants to kill Bob. Bob does not want to be killed.  Bob wants Alice return her cups to the kitchen when she is done using them.  Alice does not want to do that.
- Alice wants Bob to give her a piggyback ride.  Bob does not want to do this.  Bob wants Alice to clean up her room.  Alice does not want to clean up her room.
- Alice wants Bob's ring.  Bob does not want to give up his ring.  Bob wants Alice to work for him.   Alice does not want to work.
- Bob wants Alice to work for him.  Alice does not want to work.  Alice wants Bob to pose for a photograph.  Bob does not want to pose. 

This will be the most difficult exercise so far.  Thats ok.  The reward is here is that you now have one of the most important tools for being able to tell a story.  And, as usual, you will have satisfying feedback from your peers, and the knowledge that you are writing for an audience that is reading. 

You are doing great work, please keep it up!
