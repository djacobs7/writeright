We are the Beats
====

My goal is to write a novel, short story, television show, or sketch.

I am feeling solid about my characters so far.  I know how to create and develop a character.  If I ever need a new character, I can go and quickly redo the first 1 to 3 exercises and stop once I have defined my character in a sufficient amount of depth. 

So now we move on to scenes.  All of these things - novels and short stories and shows and basically every form of narrative ever -  are composed of 'scenes'. A nice way to think of a scene is as a character pursuing an  objective while in conflict which leads up to an  event.

For the purposes of this exercise, a scene is a series of beats in which we watch a character pursue a thing the he or she wants. ( This exercise is  focused on a character pursuing a objective.  Conflict and event, whatever those words mean, will come later ).

Like we learned in improv, a scene generally has these four elements:

CROW: character-relationship-objective-where

For this exercise, the primary focus is going to be on 'objective' - on a character's pursuit of what he or she wants.  ( Out of necessity, we will deep our feet into relationships as well )

Here are some tangible things a character might want:

- a book 
- new glasses 
- to escape from a cage
- bigger muscles
- an iPod touch
- a stuffed dinosaur
- the hope diamond

Here are some Intangible things that one character might want from another:

- love ( like a girl might want a boy to love her )
- respect  ( like an employee might want his boss to respect him )
- fear ( like a boss might want her employees to be afraid of her )
- peace  ( like a prankster who has gone to far )
- forgiveness ( like a roommate who has never done the dishes might want )
- a promise ( to go dancing; or to do the dishes ) 

For this exercise, you will need two characters.  The reason for this is that its more fun to read a scene where a character wants a thing from another character.  Its fun to watch a character try to get himself untied from a chair; its more fun to watch that character plead for it.  Because the focus of this exercise is on objective, its ok if your second character is not as well defined as the first one.

The exercise is this:
Pick a character, and show them pursuing a tangible thing that they want from another character. Make sure the scene takes place in a location.


In the spirit of 'infinite lists' this might be structured as an infinite list of 'beats'.  In each beat, the character tries some tact for achieving his or her objective.  The character is defeated, and must try a different tact.  Something might change after each beat.   Show 5-10 beats. 

* Have a clear answer to 'what is this character pursuing'
* Have a clear answer to 'why can't they just have the thing that they want'
* Try raise the stakes with each beat.
       *  Increase how much the characters have a lot to gain or to lose. 
       * Make it clear how emotionally invested your characters are.  Increase the emotional investment.
* Err on the side of making sure that the things the happen in the scene relate to what the character's want
* Stay honest to the characters who you know and invested in.

The rewards for this assignment are satisfying feedback and that you will gain skill in making sure your scenes have a purpose and are relentlessly driven forwards.   It is quite possible that you will have written something that is fun to read.
