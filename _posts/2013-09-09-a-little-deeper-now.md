A Little Bit Deeper Now


Who are you and what do you want?  A little bit deeper now!

My personal secret goal is to create a sketch, a television show, a novel or a movie.  Those all necessarily involve a set of distinct characters who are each interesting and have their own depth.  

In other words, in the next week or two, we are going to work on building a small cast.

And the first step to that, is getting to know our characters a little better.  So this week, I want redraw into the characters from last time.  I want to answer deeper questions about the people, and prove to myself that I am able to portray someone who seems relatable, human, and interesting (or I suppose unrelatable, alien and boring - the point is that they have some depth) .

First, I am going to take my huge list of characters, read over it, and pick 3-7 that I think I could work with a little more.  I'll pick the ones who I find particularly interesting, who I can start to picture in my head.  

Of those, I'll pick 2 or 3 to really focus on this week.  And I'll spend some time days kicking them around in my head. I'll interrogate them. I'll Act them out. I'll Find out more about who they are. ( You could skip this part and no one will know, but really thats the fun part! )  

Keep in mind that it would be nice if these characters somehow existed in the same world or knew each other. ( Its entirely possible that they will encounter each other in some future exercise!)

For this exercise, I am going to take those same 2-3 of my characters from last week, and explore those characters more.  For each character, I will write about a page of text.  The goal is that anyone who reads that page will understand the character very well.

I would suggest three formats for this ( don't spend more than 5 minus picking a format ):
   * a monolog in the character's voice describing what they want at this moment
   * a short story of an important moment in the characters life
   * take each of your characters through the same small stressful situation, and see how they react to it. See what else is going on in there world, and what sorts of things matter to them.  See what they want in this instant, and what they want for the next year.
      here are some sample situations
            - I missed the train
            - I can't find my car keys
            - I won a free sandwich
            -      

Here are some things you might want to know about someone who you know very well.

- How do they handle a beggar who asks for change?  
- How do they react when mom calls?  
- What was his or her last birthday like?  
- When was the last time they found themselves in a church?  
- What does his living space look like? 
- How do they deal with love?
- Can they do math in their head?
- What do they want right now?
- What do they want today? This month?  This year?

Looking forward to seeing what you come up with!
