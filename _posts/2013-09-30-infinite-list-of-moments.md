An infinite list of moments:

My goal is to write a television show, movie, or sketch. 

In order to be able to do that, I need to have a really good cast of characters, and a really strong protagonist.  One character who I have a lot of empathy with, and who I understand really well.  

This week is an exercise in getting to know one character really well, by seeing how they act in real life scenarios.

Pick one character. I will probably use one of the characters from assignment #2, because I already have some familiarity with them. (  I will keep in mind that this is just an exercise, and I am not permanently wed to this character if I don't like him or her later ! )

Write 15-30 'moments' for this character.  Aim for about 3-5 sentences each, but feel free to go on. 

The primary goal here is to learn about the character through the things that they do.

A 'moment' could be: 
 - finding the car keys
 - winning the lottery
 - their bedtime ritual
 - ordering a coffee at Starbucks 
 - right before they reach the big drop of a roller coaster
 - saying no to something they had thought about for a long time 
 - meeting another character ( like perhaps one of the others from assignment #2 or #1 ) in an intimate way, or in a casual one
If you are interested in being funny:
 - put the character in some dangerous or improbable situations  (e.g.  a teenage girl being a mall Santa, an 8 year old using a walker, old men in a nursing home doing parkour  ) 
 -put a sane man in a crazy world, or a crazy man in a sane one
 - ( this is a nice blog post on how to write comedic moments, which is the inspiration for these bullet points )




Things that your audience will be reading for:
- what are the character's flaws
  - seriously, try to make sure you have a list of their flaws
- why is this character special?
  - there is a difference between being Generic Spy #4124 and between being James Bond 
- if you only had 5 seconds ( like in a movie trailer ) to give an impression of a character, which of these moments would you show? 
- what parts of themselves does the character show? which parts do they hide?

Hopefully, your audience will come away from this understanding the character really well, and wanting to learn more; and you, as a writer, should have a really good sense of what this character does.  And you will have had fun and completed a very difficult task of writing a character who seems real.  Kudos to you!

I am estimating that I will finish this around Wednesday September 18th.

By the way, to give credit where it is due, a lot of this is inspired by the various essays in the fantastic: 'Now Write! Screenwriting' ( http://www.amazon.com/Now-Write-Screenwriting-Exercises-Teachers/dp/1585428515 )
