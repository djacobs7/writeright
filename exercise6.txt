I want to write a novel or short story or film.

In order to do that, I need several characters who I know and understand well.  That way, it will be easier to place them in relation to each other.  So this is an exercise in building character.  When you are finished, you will have another tool in your tool box for the next time you need to understand one of your characters more fully.

The exercise is to write a autobiography from the perspective of a character. Keep it to a page or two ( or more is ok too! ) Details follow:

Write this line, "Hi, my name is __________"  You don't have to write it in those words, you can write it in the voice of the character, like "Howdy, I'm _____ " or "Oh hey there," or "Merhaba!" 

Then, continue to write from the perspective of the character.  You do not need to decide who this character is before writing, but if you already have some idea, then great.  Maybe its a character you have been waiting to explore more, or maybe its someone completely new.

Just write what is on the character's mind and don't censor it too much.  What are they thinking about?  

Get these questions answered:
Who am I?
   How old?  How do I look? What do I wear? 
Where am I from?
  Where did I grow up?  Am I rich or poor?  Whats was my family like?  What was my relationship like with my parents? With my siblings?  How was I educated in school?  Did I get in trouble a lot? What did I want to be when I grew up?  What were my dreams as  a kid?
   who did I spend time with half my lifetime ago?  Who did I spend time with 1 quarter of my lifetime ago?
   what is my profession?  how did I end up doing that?
   what does an average day look like for me nowadays?
How do I feel about everything?
   politics? religion?  authority? relationships!  Who are the people in my life and how do I feel about them?
Why am I writing an autobiography?
  What makes them special enough for this to be worth doing? What are they the best at?  What makes them likable?

In the interests of citing my sources, I have to say that this exercise is basically copied from "Now Write! Screenwriting" edited by Sherry Ellis, and can be found on  pp. 236.
